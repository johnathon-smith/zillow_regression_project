## Zillow Regression Project
***

### Project Summary
***

#### Goals
* Predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses using the property data from those with a transaction during the "hot months" (in terms of real estate demand) of May-August, 2017.
* Determine the state and county location of each property.
* Calculate and chart the tax rate distributions for each county.

#### Audience
* The Zillow data science team.

#### Deliverables
* A five minute verbal presentation supported with slides.
* A Github Repository containing:
    1) A clearly labeled final report jupyter notebook.
    2) The .py files necessary to reproduce my work for anyone with their own env.py file.
* Finally, a README.md file documenting your project planning with instructions on how someone could clone and reproduce your project on their own machine. Include at least your goals for the project, a data dictionary, and key findings and takeaways.

#### Context
* The Zillow data I'm using was acquired from the Codeup Database.
